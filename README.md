# tenden|see

tenden|see allows users to manage and track daily tasks like any other habit tracker.  Unlike the other apps out there, tenden|see uses photos to increase adherence by simplifying the checking off of a daily task, making that process more rewarding, and adding an element of social proof.  tenden|see was built in React Native / Redux with a RESTful Node / Express server and a MySQL relational database and has been optimized for both iOS and Android.
